	</div>
	<div id="box">
	  <p>Hello! My name is Nida Akkiswala, a 18 year old freshman. I am currently majoring in ITM at IIT. I was born and raised in Chicago, Illinois though I can't say I know the city much other than the museums. I like going out with friends occasionally and making plans that somehow never happen because they are so grand. </p>

	  <h1>Hobbies</h1>
	</div>
	<div id="box">
	  <p>I don't have many outdoor hobbies as I am a more indoor person unless I'm forced out by friends. 
	  <ul>
	    <li>Reading (Books/Manga)</li>
		<li>Watching Anime</li>
		<li>Sleeping</li>
		<li>Hiking</li>
		<li>Playing games like escape rooms(I've never done it but it sounds fun), laser tag, etc.</li>

	  <h1>Anime Opening That Plays on Repeat</h1>
	</div>
	<div id="box">
	  <p>At the moment there aren't any animes I'm watching except for Moriarty the Patriot. It has just started its second season so I'm hyped for that. The opening and the ending of the first season was really dope and its an absolute artistic masterpiece. Parts of the opening plays on repeat in my head along with certain parts of the second season's opening.</p>
